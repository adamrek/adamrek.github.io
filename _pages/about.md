## About Me

I am a graduate student at **Kyoto University**, based in Kyoto, Japan.

My research interests focus on **electromyography (EMG) signals**, **deep learning**, and **human–computer interaction (HCI)**. I am particularly interested in applying modern deep learning methods to EMG-based sensing and interaction, with the goal of enabling more natural and intelligent human–machine interfaces.

My work lies at the intersection of signal processing, machine learning, and interactive systems, aiming to bridge physiological signals with practical human-centered applications.

I am currently affiliated with Kyoto University and actively engaged in research in these areas. I am open to academic discussion and collaboration.

## 关于我

我目前是**京都大学**的研究生，常驻日本京都。

我的研究兴趣主要集中在**肌电（EMG）信号**、**深度学习**以及**人机交互**等方向，关注如何利用深度学习方法对生理信号进行建模与理解，从而实现更加自然、高效的人机交互方式。

我的研究工作位于信号处理、机器学习与交互系统的交叉领域，致力于将生理信号与实际人机应用相结合。
