### Abstract
We propose **Q-DFN (Q-learning Decisive Fusion Network)**, a novel fusion framework for object detection that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically select and fuse multi-source detection results. By modeling the fusion process as a Markov decision problem and employing Q-learning, the proposed method improves detection robustness and accuracy compared with static fusion strategies.
